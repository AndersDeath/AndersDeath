## Vladimir Bolshakov

Hello everybody. I like calling myself a programmer. I work in IT for whole life. I started programming at the age of 14 and I still do it.
For now, Iâ€™m working as a team leader for DrSmile. It's Berlin's company that sells teeth aligners and supports all stages of patients' treatment.

My main focus is front-end technologies, but I also have expertise in backend and mobile development. I like managing people as well. So far I have a strong desire to help other people to become programmers. If you look for a mentor I will be happy to help you.
