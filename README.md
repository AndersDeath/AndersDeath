Hello everybody. 

My name is Vladimir Bolshakov and I am a programmer. At the same time, I am working for Berlin's company DR SMILE as a Team Leader and Senior front-end and mobile engineer.

I've started programming when I was 14 years old. At the age of 18, I've started working as a programmer. For more than 15 years I've worked as a freelancer as an individual entrepreneur, or in big and small companies as an engineer or manager. Ialso tried to build startups. My main interest in technologies are related to the web. I have expertise in backend and front-end programming as well.

If you want to discuss something, or suggest participation in some interesting project, I will be very happy to talk to you.

Best regard,
Vladimir Bolshakov.
